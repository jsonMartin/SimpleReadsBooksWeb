		<p class="font-medium -mt-[30px]">Welcome to Simple Reads Books!<br /></p>
		<p class="font-medium">
			My name is Deborah Martin and I am the author of the Hunnie Bunny book series.
		</p>

		<p>
			I have always enjoyed writing children’s stories and decided to finally publish Hunnie Bunny’s
			Garden after my grandson’s birth In August of 2022. Even though I wrote Hunnie Bunny’s Garden
			in 1985 when my son was two years old, I never forgot about the story and recently was able to
			find the perfect illustrator to bring the story to life.
		</p>

		<p>
			Growing up in Roanoke, Virginia, we had lots of pets, including cats, dogs, bunnies, birds and
			fish, all at the same time. So, it was natural for me to write about animals as I grew older.
			I believe that children learn empathy, respect and responsibility when pets are part of the
			family.
		</p>

		<p>
			Horses have always been my first love and true passion, and I was fortunate to buy my first
			horse when I was in college. Some of my best years were spent showing my thoroughbred mare in
			hunter shows.
		</p>

		<p>
			When I moved to California, I gave up riding to raise my family and didn’t buy another horse
			until our son went off to college. I now have three horses, a chestnut Appendix Quarter horse
			gelding named Crimson Sky, a black German warmblood gelding named San Fransisko, and a bay
			Oldenburg gelding named Santana. All three are trained in dressage and have done extremely
			well at shows with their professional rider.
		</p>

		<p>
			Besides my horses, I have two other four-legged children: a fifteen-year-old Bluepoint
			Balinese cat named Zoie (who is quite the diva in our house) and an eight-year-old Bluepoint
			Birman/Siamese mix named Rascal (who definitely lives up to his name). They are wonderful
			companions, and my home wouldn’t be the same without them!
		</p>

		<p>
			I hope you will join the Simple Reads Books community and share my books with your family and
			friends. Enjoy!
